# Interactive 3-D portfolio using ThreeJS
All credits to Jesse Zhou (jesse-zhou.com) https://github.com/enderh3art/Ramen-Shop <br>

Portfolio project using Three.js and Blender. <br>
All text appearing in the project is actually graphics in .ktx2 format.<br>
So all designs first must be created in .png format as an image, then use a free tool at https://gestaltor.io/ to convert image to graphics. <br>
Then import the created graphics inside the project.
